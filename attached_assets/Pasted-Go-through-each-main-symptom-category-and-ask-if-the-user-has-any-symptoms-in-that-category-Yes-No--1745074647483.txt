Collect all selected symptoms.

Analyze symptoms using the disease prediction model from https://github.com/VihaanMa11/health:

Use the Training.csv or Testing.csv symptom matrix.

Feed the binary-encoded symptoms into the trained model (Random Forest or Decision Tree).

Output top 1–3 most likely diseases.

Respond to the user with the analysis:

"Based on the symptoms you provided, here are the most likely conditions:"

1. [Disease Name] – short description

2. [Disease Name] – short description

I recommend consulting a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.

Note for developers: Implement the chatbot logic using frameworks like:

Streamlit or Gradio for UI

Scikit-learn for disease prediction (same as in the GitHub project)

Optionally integrate with Dialogflow, Rasa, or LangChain for conversational memory and flow
